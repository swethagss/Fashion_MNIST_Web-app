# Fashion Item Classifier Web App

This is a simple web application built using **Streamlit** that classifies fashion items (such as T-shirts, trousers, shoes, etc.) from the **Fashion MNIST** dataset using a **TensorFlow** model.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload an image (JPG, PNG, or JPEG) of a fashion item.
- **Prediction**: The model will predict the fashion item based on the uploaded image.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Get predictions in real-time after uploading the image.


## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.6+ and the following libraries:

- **Streamlit**: for building the web interface.
- **TensorFlow**: for loading and using the pre-trained model.
- **Pillow**: for image handling.
- **NumPy**: for data manipulation.

- ### Libraries:
- streamlit
- tensorflow
- pillow
- numpy
